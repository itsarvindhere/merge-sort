The Merge Sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm that is based on the Divide and Conquer paradigm. In this algorithm, the array is initially divided into two equal halves and then they are combined in a sorted manner.

This is much faster than Bubble Sort, Selection Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms because the Worst Case time complexity of Merge Sort is O(NLogN).

Think of it as a recursive algorithm that continuously splits the array in half until it cannot be further divided. This means that if the array becomes empty or has only one element left, the dividing will stop, i.e. it is the base case to stop the recursion. 

If the array has multiple elements, split the array into halves and recursively invoke the merge sort on each of the halves. Finally, when both halves are sorted, the merge operation is applied. Merge operation is the process of taking two smaller sorted arrays and combining them to eventually make a larger one.

# HOW DO WE SORT THE HALVES OF THE ARRAY SO THAT WE CAN MERGE THEM?

Merging of two sorted arrays into one is not complex but the main thing in Merge Sort is to Sort the two halves. For this, we will use the "Divide and Conquer" approach. We will split the halves further into even smaller portions. And we keep doing that until we have only one element in each of the two halves.

   If we had [2,4,1,6,8,5,3,7]
   Then, we split it into [2,4,1,6] and [8,5,3,7]

   Now, we again split these two parts.

   [2,4,1,6] is split into [2,4] and [1,6]
   [8,5,3,7] is split into [8,5] and [3,7]

   We again split them.

   [2,4] is split into [2] and [4]
   [1,6] is split into [1] and [6]
   [8,5] is split into [8] and [5]
   [3,7] is split into [3] and [7]

   And now, we see that the arrays are having only one element.

   So we cannot further split any array now.


So, now that we have only one element in each subarray, we can easily combine them into one single sorted array because each subarray in itself is already sorted as each has one element only.

So now, it is time to Merge two sorted arrays.

So, we will merge -

    [2] and [4] into [2,4]
    [1] and [6] into [1,6]
    [8] and [5] into [5,8]
    [3] and [7] into [3,7]

And now again, we will merge -

    [2,4] and [1,6] into [1,2,4,6]
    [5,8] and [3,7] into [3,5,7,8]

And finally, we wll merge - 

    [1,2,4,6] and [3,5,7,8] into [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

And that's how we will get our sorted array.


# SORTING - PSEUDOCODE

Suppose we have a method MergeSort(A) where "A" is the array that we have to sort. 

We know that we have to split the array till we have only one element. After that it cannot be split. So we have to check before spliting whether "N" or length of "A" is < 2 or not. If yes, then we cannot split and we can return.

Otherwise, we will split the array into two halves "L" and "R" and we will split at "mid" position. So, first array has "mid" elements and other will have "n - mid" elements.

Now as we saw, we have to split these two arrays further. So, we have to make a recursive call now for each subarray "L" and "R" separately.

Once that completes, we can them Merge the two halves.

So now, the code will be like - 

    MergeSort(A):
        N = len(A)

        # Base Case
        if N < 2: return

        # Two Halves
        mid = N // 2
        L = [0] * mid
        R = [0] * (N - mid)

        # Fill the halves
        for i in range(mid): L[i] = A[i]
        for i in range(mid, n): R[i - mid] = A[i]

        # Recursive Call for Sorting each half
        MergeSort(L)
        MergeSort(R)

        # Once both left and right are sorted we can merge
        Merge(L, R, A)

# HOW DO WE MERGE TWO SORTED ARRAYS?

Let us now understand how can we merge two sorted arrays into one.

    Suppose, we have an unsorted array -> [2,4,1,6,8,5,3,7]

    And suppose our two halves are [2,4,1,6] and [8,5,3,7]

    When they are sorted, we get [1,2,4,6] and [3,5,7,8]

    Now, we have to merge these two halves.

So, looking at these two, it makes sense that either the first element of left half or the first element of right half will become the first element of the final sorted array, right?

This means, either "1" or "3" will be the first element of final array. And so, we have to check which one is smaller. Here, "1" is smaller so we will override the final array and put "1" at the first place. 

Now in left half, we are at "2". At right half, we are still at "3". We again compare the two. Since "2" is smaller, we will put "2" at the 2nd place in final array.

And this way, we will keep doing this overriding of values in the final array, based on which one is smaller.

In the end, either we would've used all values from left half or from right half. So what we will do is simply take all remaining values and put them as they are in the final array because they are already in sorted order and we have nothing left toc ompare them with.

# MERGING - PSEUDOCODE

Suppose we have a method Merge(L, R, A, nL, nR) which takes five arguments -> Left sorted half, Right sorted half, final array, length of left half and length of right half.

Now, to track the positions in these three arrays, we will need three pointers. 

Let's take i, j and k.

    i -> Pointer for L
    j -> Pointer for R
    k -> Pointer for A

So, now, the code will be like -

        Merge(L, R, A, nL, nR):
            i,j,k = 0,0,0
            while i < nL and j < nR:
                if L[i] <= R[i]:
                    A[k] = L[i]
                    i += 1
                else:
                    A[k] = R[j]
                    j += 1
                k += 1

            # Here, either left half will have some elements left
            # Or the right half will have some elements left

            # If left half has some elements left
            while i < nL:
                A[k] = L[i]
                i += 1
                k += 1

            # If right half has some elements left
            while j < nR:
                A[k] = R[j]
                j += 1
                k += 1
