1. Merge Sort Algorithms Falls into the category of "Divide and Conquer" Algorithms because in this algorithm we divide the problem into sub problems and solve those sub problems first.

2. It is also a Stable sorting algorithm. Stable sorting algorithms maintain the relative order of records with equal keys.

Suppose, if we have points on a cartesian plane that we have to sort - 

    (1,2), (2,5), (5,10), (2,3), (4,6), (3,7)

Suppose we have to sort based on the "X" axis value. Now we see that we have (2,5) and (2,3) with the same value of "X" coordinate. But, since (2,5) occurs before (2,3) in the original list, its order remains unchanged. This is called a Stable Sorting Algorithm.

That is, a sorting algorithm is stable if whenever there are two records R and S with the same key and with R appearing before S in the original list, R will appear before S in the sorted list.

3. Merge Sort is not an "In-Place" sorting algorithm. "In-Place" means we are using only constant space and the space taken is not dependent on the array that we have to sort. Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort and Selection Sort are all In-Place sorting algorithms.

But in Merge Sort, we have to use Extra Space to split the array into two halves so if the array is large, we will need more space. So, the space used depends on the input array, hence it is not an In-Place sorting algorithm.

Space Complexity of Merge Sort is O(N) which means Memory consumption is propotional to the Elements in original array.

4. Time complexity of Merge Sort is O(NLogN) in Worst Case.
